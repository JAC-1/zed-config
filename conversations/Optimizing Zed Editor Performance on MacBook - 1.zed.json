Update Zed: Ensure you're using the latest version of Zed, as newer versions often include performance improvements.\n\n2. Close unnecessary applications: Free up system resources by closing apps you're not actively using.\n\n3. Manage extensions: Disable or remove any unnecessary extensions that might be slowing down the editor.\n\n4. Clear cache: Periodically clear Zed's cache to prevent buildup that could slow performance.\n\n5. Adjust settings: \n   - Disable unnecessary features like real-time linting or auto-completion if you don't need them.\n   - Reduce the number of open files and projects.\n   - Lower the font ligatures setting if it's enabled.\n\n6. Optimize your MacBook:\n   - Keep macOS updated.\n   - Use Activity Monitor to identify and quit resource-heavy processes.\n   - Consider increasing your MacBook's RAM if possible.\n   - Ensure you have sufficient free disk space.\n\n7. Use a solid-state drive (SSD): If your MacBook doesn't already have one, consider upgrading to an SSD for faster read/write speeds.\n\n8. Limit background processes: Disable unnecessary startup items and background processes.\n\n9. Monitor CPU temperature: Ensure your MacBook isn't overheating, which can lead to thermal throttling.\n\n10. Contact Zed support: If issues persist, reach out to Zed's support team for specific guidance tailored to your setup.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of these optimizations may vary depending on your specific MacBook model and usage patterns.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":75,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":1637,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Optimizing Zed Editor Performance on MacBook","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
